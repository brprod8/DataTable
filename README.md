*This project displays data from a space program in a table format, and includes functionality to display the current time and track the elapsed time*


# Table Display

The data is displayed in a table format, with columns for different data types and rows for individual readings. The data includes information such as latitude, longitude, altitude, temperature, pressure, and sensor readings.

# Current Time Display

The project includes a function to display the current time on the webpage. This is accomplished using the Date object in JavaScript to get the current time, and then adding the time to a paragraph element which is appended to the webpage.

# Elapsed Time Tracking

The project also includes a timer function to track the elapsed time since the timer was started. When the timer is started, the elapsed time is displayed in a table cell and is updated every 10 milliseconds. The elapsed time is highlighted in yellow to indicate that it is being tracked.

# Start and Stop Buttons

The timer function includes start and stop buttons to control the timer. When the start button is clicked, the timer begins tracking the elapsed time. When the stop button is clicked, the timer stops and the elapsed time is no longer highlighted.

# Technologies Used
This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the data and add functionality to the webpage. The table formatting is accomplished using HTML table elements and CSS styling. The JavaScript code includes functions to display the current time and track the elapsed time, and event listeners to handle button clicks.

# Installation and Usage
To use this project, simply download the files and open the HTML file in a web browser. The webpage will display the table of data, the current time, and the start and stop buttons for the timer. Click the start button to start tracking the elapsed time, and click the stop button to stop the timer.

# Future Development
Possible future developments for this project include:

Adding additional data types to the table display
Implementing a more sophisticated timer function, such as one that can be paused and resumed
Adding graphs or visualizations to display the data over time
